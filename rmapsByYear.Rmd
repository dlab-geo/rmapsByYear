# About

This tutorial shows two methods for creating time series maps of state-level data by year using the R statistical programming language. The two main R libraries we use to create these maps are **rMaps** (http://rmaps.github.io/) and **ggplot2** (http://ggplot2.org)

## rMaps
The R package `rMaps` provides a simple set of commands for creating animated, interactive choropleth maps. A choropleth map is one in which regions, such as states, are symbolized (e.g. colored) by data values for those regions. The output of rMaps can be saved to an HTML file that you can open in a web brower. This allows you to view a year's worth of data and advance through all years using a slider or button control on the map. Interactivity is added in the form of popup windows that can display. An example of an rMaps choropleth map is shown below.

For details on how to install rMaps and create choropleth maps see the [rMaps github site](https://github.com/ramnathv/rMaps). You can also read about the genesis of rMaps in [this blog post](http://rmaps.github.io/blog/posts/animated-choropleths/) by its creator, Ramnath Vaidyanathan. The underlying funcitionality for creating these maps is provided by Datamaps (http://datamaps.github.io/), a javascript library. 

This tutorial provides additional rMaps examples and tips as well as custom code for extending the functionality of rMaps.

## ggplot
The `ggplot2` package is a widely used and extremely powerful R library for creating and customizing many different types of data plots including scatterplots, bar plots, and histograms, etc., as well as maps. We will use this library to create micromaps - a series of small maps for the same region, in this case US states, where the data vary along one facet, here time. We include this section in the tutorial to provide an alternate   method for geographically visualizing many years of data. An example is shown below.

# Motivation
The main reason we chose to use R as opposed to another software tool are that the rMaps and ggplot packages allow us to create the desired output with relatively few steps. Our input data is in a spreadsheet, not a geographic data file format like the shapefile, and most of our statistical analysis is done in MS Excel. R provides one line code for reading in these files and rMaps provides one line for creating the interactive annual map series. As with most data projects the vast majority of the effort is in preparing the data in the format needed to produce the desired output. Our work is not exception. But the analyst can do that processing in the software of their choice, be it excel, R or another tool.

Another benefit of using R was that we wanted a workflow that could be done locally rather than with an online tool (e.g. [CARTO](http://carto.com), [Shiny](http://www.shinyapps.io/), [Tableau](http://www.tableau.com) to keep our work and data relatively private until we are ready to share it. Moreover, we wanted to use a free software tool rather than pay for software when were were unsure of the outcome.


# Data

To follow along with this tutorial we use the *U.S. State-Level Income Inequality Data* provided by Mark W. Frank on the website: http://www.shsu.edu/eco_mwf/inequality.html.The specific data file that we downloaded and preprocessed to create some sample data sets is: [http://www.shsu.edu/eco_mwf/Frank_WTID_2013.xls](http://www.shsu.edu/eco_mwf/Frank_WTID_2013.xls). We have copied and created subsets of these data to facilitate this tutorial.

 
# RMaps

### Step 1. Install required R libraries
```{r results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Install helper packages
required.pkg <- c('tidyr','plyr','dplyr','RColorBrewer','readxl','devtools','downloader')
pkgs.not.installed <- required.pkg[!sapply(required.pkg, function(p) require(p, character.only=T))]
if (length(pkgs.not.installed > 0)) {
  install.packages(pkgs.not.installed, dependencies=TRUE)
} else {
  print("Helper packages installed.")
}

# Install rMaps and rCharts packages for creating the map
if ("rMaps" %in% rownames(installed.packages()) == FALSE ) {
  require(devtools)
  install_github('ramnathv/rCharts@dev')
  install_github('ramnathv/rMaps')
} else {
  print("Rmaps installed.")
}
```


### Step 2. Load the required R libraries
```{r results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#--------------------
# Load Libraries
#--------------------
#library(reshape2)
#library(plyr)
library(tidyr)
library(plyr)
library(dplyr)
library(readxl)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(rCharts)
library(rMaps)
```


### Step 3. Read in data in the format required by *rMaps*
```{r, echo=TRUE}
# set working directory
my_rmaps_directory <- "~/Documents/Dlab/consults/robin_e/rmapsByYear"
setwd(my_rmaps_directory)

# Identify the data to be mapped
in_data_file <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dlab-geo/rmapsByYear/master/data/Frank_WTID_2013_top1_long_2000to2013.csv"

# Read in the data
indata <- read.csv(in_data_file, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Take a look at the data
head(indata)

# Subset the data to make it more manageable for this tutorial
indata <- subset(indata, year > 2000)

# Range of data values
summary(indata$vals)

# Years 
sort(unique(indata$year))
```



### Step 4. Create an rMap

You can geographically visualize the data with the rMaps `ichoropleth` function. A simple call to this function using the basic paramaters is shown below. You can read this as "Create a choropleth map of the data in the `indata` data frame using the data in the `vals` column to symbolize the regions identified in the `State` column. For this basic functionality, rMaps requires map regions to be US states identified by their two letter abbreviations. These identifiers are used to access map data in the Datamaps package. The animate parameter identifies the column in the data frame that contains the year for each data observation.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ichoropleth(vals ~ State, data = indata,  animate = 'year')
```

<img src="images/ic_plot1.png" width="600px" />


#### Save the output map to an HTML file
You can save the ichoropleth map to an HTML file. This way you can share the map by emailing it or posting it on a website or simply by displaying it locally in the web browser on your computer.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
map1 <- ichoropleth(vals ~ State, data = indata,  animate = 'year')
map1$save('map1.html', cdn=TRUE)
```

Above, setting the value `cdn=TRUE` embeds references to required javascript libraries as URLs inside the output HTML file rather than needing to include the code for those libraries in our HTML file. Bottom line - this keeps the file size smaller.

If you navigate to your working directory you can double-click on your HTML file (above named `map1.html`) to view your ichoropleth map.



#### Setting Map Colors

You can vary the color palatte (or pal) by using one of the named options provided by the `rColorBrewer` package.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
display.brewer.all()
```
<img src="images/brewer_pals.png" width="600px" />

  
In the image above there are three families of color palettes:

1. `sequentional`, eg YlOrRd, which can be used to highlight numeric values as they increase or decrease
2. `categorical`, eg., Set3, used to symbolize different categories of data
3. `divergent`, eg. Spectral, used to identify deviations around the mean values

For these data a sequential or divergent color palette would work best. Let's try YlOrRd (yellow-orange-red).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ichoropleth(vals ~ State, data = indata,  animate = 'year', pal='YlOrRd')
```
<img src="images/ic_plot2.png" width="600px" />

  
You can add more bins for symbolizing the data. With R color brewer sequential palettes you can use up to 9, with divergent palettes 11. The recommended number is between 3-7 and the default for ichoropleth is 5. See ?brewer.pal for details.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ichoropleth(vals ~ State, data = indata,  animate = 'year', pal='YlOrRd', ncuts=9)
```
<img src="images/ic_plot3.png" width="600px" />


### Other map options

Hide the map legend and / or the state abbreviation labels
```{r, eval=FALSE}
ichoropleth(vals ~ State, data = indata,  animate = 'year', pal='YlOrRd', legend=FALSE, labels=FALSE)
```


Customize the map style
```{r, eval=FALSE}

# Map only one year of data - in other words create a static map
ichoropleth(vals ~ State, data = subset(indata, year == 2005))

# Map a subset of years
ichoropleth(vals ~ State, data = subset(indata, year > 2005), animate="year")

# Add a Play button to advance through the year-levels automatically
ichoropleth(vals ~ State, data = subset(indata, year > 2005), animate="year", play=TRUE)
```


For more options to the ichoropleth function see: http://rmaps.github.io/blog/posts/animated-choropleths/ and the GitHub page for rmaps at: 
https://github.com/ramnathv/rMaps.


### Step 5. Add Popups to the Map

By default, ichoropleth displays the full name of a state in a popup window when you move your mouse and hover over a state. You can customize the content of the popup to display the data value for a state for the given year. This is helpful if you do not want to display a legend or if you want to convey additional information.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
map2 <- ichoropleth(vals ~ State, data = indata, animate="year")
map2$set(
  geographyConfig = list(
    popupTemplate = "#! function(geo, data){ return '<div class=\"hoverinfo\">' 
      + geo.properties.name + ' ' + data.year +  '<br>' +  + data.vals + '%' +  
    '</div>';  } !#"
  )
)
map2
map2$save('map2.html', cdn=TRUE)
```


In the example above we save the ichoropleth map to the variable `map2`. We then pass additional customizations to *Datamaps* that create a custom popup.  The `popupTemplate` is a function that identifies the name of each state (geo.properties.name), the year for the data (data.year) and the data value for the state for that year (data.vals).  The values for data.year and data.vals come from the data frame that is used to create the map, in this case `indata`. In addition, we add to the popup a percent sign at the end of the data value using the code `'%'`.  The code `'\<br\>'` adds a line break between the state name and year and the data value.  You can pass any column that is in the input data frame (here indata) to the popupTemplate. For example, you can add a column called `popup_text` to your input data frame and populated it with a nicely formatted version of your data values you can then reference in the popupTemplate as `data.popup_text`.


## Step 5. Datamaps Customizations

You can pass options to the underlying Datamaps library to further customize your maps. Refer to the [Datamaps website](http://datamaps.github.io/) and [custom maps](https://github.com/markmarkoh/datamaps/) web page for details. Those pages show how to make Datamaps changes to javascript code. However, implementing Datamaps customizations in rMaps can be complex. The basic method for implementing Datamaps changes is with the `map.set()` function. We used that above to create popups for map2.

### Changing the map data

One customization that you may want to make is to change the map data. We decided to do this for the following reason. We noticed that when using the default US states data Washington DC is so small you cannot hover over it and see its popup. Consequently we downloaded the states data and made DC a bit bigger so we could see the popup. 

By default ichoropleth uses the Datamaps USA states data which is stored in a `TopoJSON` file, which is a compressed variant of a [GeoJSON file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON#TopoJSON).  Each US State in the TopoJSON file has an `ID` with the state abbreviaton, a `name` property with the full state name, and geometry `arcs` that identifies the boundary of each state. Together these data have the `layer name` *usa*. You can see this information by looking at the [Datamaps USA TopoJSON file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markmarkoh/datamaps/master/src/js/data/usa.topo.json).

<img src="images/datamaps_topo.png" />

You can use a custom map with ichoropleth if the following conditions are true.
1.  The geographic data are in a TopoJSON (not GeoJSON) file and you can access that file via a URL, 
2.  You can identify the `layer name` of the data in the TopoJson file.  You can see above the layer name `usa` right after the keyword `objects`. If the name is not `usa` it needs to be set using the `scope` Datamaps variable.
3. The id of each polygon in the TopoJSON file is has a corresponding value in the R data frame. Thus far our rMaps have used state abbrevation in the States column.

Because we copied the Datamaps USA TopoJSON file (2) and (3) above are the same. We can just add a `dataUrl` parameter to access our custom TopoJSON file.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
map3 <- ichoropleth(vals ~ State, data = indata, animate="year")
map3$set(
  geographyConfig = list(
    #dataUrl = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dlab-geo/rmapsByYear/master/data/usa_with_bigger_DC_topo.json",
    dataUrl = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dlab-geo/rmapsByYear/master/data/state_squares_topo.json",
    popupTemplate = "#! function(geo, data){ return '<div class=\"hoverinfo\">' + geo.properties.name + ' ' + data.year +  '<br>' +  + data.vals + '%' +  '</div>';  } !#"
  ) 
)
map3
map3$save('map3.html', cdn=TRUE)
```

If you compare `map2.html` with `map3.html` you will see that map3.html allows you to view the popup for Washington D.C!

### Mapping States as Squares

With a completely different TopoJSON file you need to make a few more customizations. This [R-bloggers post](https://www.r-bloggers.com/rmaps-mexico-map/) walks you through the details. Inspired by this [Obesity map series](http://flowingdata.com/2016/09/26/the-spread-of-obesity/) we wanted to try visualizing the data with States represented as squares instead of the actual state boundaries. This technique minimizes the differences do to the land area yet retains locational familiarity. 

We downloaded this state squares [GeoJSON file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geobabbler/us-state-squares/master/state_squares.geojson) from Bill Dollin's GitHub site (referenced in [blog post by Kyle Walker](http://rpubs.com/walkerke/obesity_squares)) and converted it to a TopoJSON file. By looking at the data in this file we could see that the layer name is `state_squares`. 
Kyle Walker's blog post also recommends displaying the state squares using an `equirectangular` map projection. Setting the projection parameters in rMaps/Datamaps is very complex even when you know about map projections & coordinate reference systems, topics beyond the scope of this tutorial. Folks without this knowledge can use rMaps and Datamaps to create great maps. But to go beyound the defaults map data requires learning about geographic data along with some experimentation (i.e. cut, paste & edit until it works). Fortunately the [map example](http://geobabbler.github.io/assets/demos/us-states-squares/example/) in Bill Dollin's github site provides the needed projection parameters.


Below we show how to use the states squares data in a custom rMap. In this case we specifiy the name of the map layer by setting 'scope=state_squares'. The `setProjection` parameter refers to the parameters of the map projection used to locate the map data in geographic space. Additionally, in the popup we change the variable used to map the state name to `geo.id`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
map4 <- ichoropleth(vals ~ State, data = indata, animate="year")
map4$set(
   geographyConfig = list(
    dataUrl = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dlab-geo/rmapsByYear/master/data/state_squares_topo.json",
    popupTemplate = "#! function(geo, data){ return '<div class=\"hoverinfo\">' + geo.id + ' ' + data.year +  '<br>' +  + data.vals + '%' +  '</div>';  } !#"
  ) ,
  scope="state_squares",
  setProjection = '#! function( element, options ) {
    var projection, path;
    projection = d3.geo.equirectangular()
      .scale(2000)
      .center([-96,41])
      .translate([element.offsetWidth / 2, element.offsetHeight / 2]);
    path = d3.geo.path().projection( projection );
    return {path: path, projection: projection};
  } !#'
)
map4
map4$save('map4.html', cdn=TRUE)
```


That works pretty well, but the squares spread out the country in too elongated a fashion. Let's try the `mercator` projection which will give a North-South stretch to the map data. Consquently we set the map hieght to `600` pixels. The default height is 500 which cuts off some of the data. Try changing it.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
map5 <- ichoropleth(vals ~ State, data = indata, animate="year")
map5$set(
  geographyConfig = list(
    dataUrl = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dlab-geo/rmapsByYear/master/data/state_squares_topo.json",
    popupTemplate = "#! function(geo, data){ return '<div class=\"hoverinfo\">' + geo.id + ' ' + data.year +  '<br>' +  + data.vals + '%' +  '</div>';  } !#"
  ) ,
  scope="state_squares",
  height=600,
  setProjection = '#! function( element, options ) {
    var projection, path;
    projection = d3.geo.mercator()
      .scale(2000)
      .center([-96,41])
      .translate([element.offsetWidth / 2, element.offsetHeight / 2]);
    path = d3.geo.path().projection( projection );
    return {path: path, projection: projection};
  } !#'
)
map5
mapt$save('map5.html', cdn=TRUE)
